            2PAC-All Eyes On Me<br>
            I bet you got it twisted,<br>
            You don’t know who to trust<br>
            So many player hating nigga tryna sound like us<br>
            Say they ready for the funk, I don’t think they knowing<br>
            Straight to the depths of hell is where them coward going<br>
            Well? Are you still down nigga holla when you see me<br>
            And let these devil be sorry for the day they finally freed me<br>
            I got a caravan of niggas every time we ride<br>
            Hitting up niggas when we pass by<br>
            Until I die, live the life of a boss player<br>
            Cause even when I am high fuck with me and get cross later <br>
            the future in my eyes cause all I want is cash and thang<br>
            A five double oh Benz flauntin flashy rings uhh pursue me like a dream<br>
            Been known to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend<br>
            It seems, my main thing was to be major paid<br>
            the game sharper than a mf rajor blade<br>
            Say money bring bitches and bitches bring lies <br>
            One nigga getting jealous and mother fucker dies<br>
            Depend on me like the first and fifteen <br>
            they might hold me for a second<br>
